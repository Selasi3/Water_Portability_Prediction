# 🚰 WATER POTABILITY PREDICTION

> The supply of safe drinking water is one of the greatest public health achievements ever! Potable water should be accessible to all. Using machine learning algorithms, this project aims at providing an easy way of predicting if water is potable or not.

> The dataset used in this project was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
